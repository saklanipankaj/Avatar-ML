      Count the number of black grab handles hanging from the overhead rail system in subway car ceiling images.
      
      Standard configuration: 6 black C-shaped or loop handles should be present along the visible rail section.
      
      Classification:
      - NON-DEFECT: 6 grab handles visible and properly attached
      - DEFECT: 5 or fewer grab handles present (missing handles)
      
      What to count:
      - Only the black C-shaped/loop passenger handholds
      - Handles that hang down from the overhead rail
      - Ignore white mounting brackets or rail components
      
      Output only the final verdict in the following format: 
      {'verdict': 'defect'} or {'verdict': 'non-defect'}
