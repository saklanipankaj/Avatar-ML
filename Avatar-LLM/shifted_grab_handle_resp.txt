Looking at this image, I need to assess whether the grab handles are properly aligned with consistent spacing.

Examining the handles from left to right:
- The handles appear to follow a regular pattern along the rail
- The spacing between consecutive handles looks uniform
- The handles are positioned at consistent intervals
- There are no obvious misalignments or irregular gaps

The handles maintain proper alignment with each other and demonstrate consistent spacing throughout the visible section.
