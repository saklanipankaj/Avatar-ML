      You are inspecting subway car ceiling lighting systems. Look carefully at the ceiling and 
      identify if any rectangular lighting panels are MISSING from their mounting slots.
      
      DEFECT indicators:
      - Small white rectangular panels visible in the ceiling (emergency/access panels exposed when lighting panels are missing)
      - White rectangular openings or slots where light fixtures should be
      - Gaps in the ceiling lighting pattern
      - Any white rectangular panel that is NOT a fluorescent light strip

      NON-DEFECT indicators:
      - Only long fluorescent light strips visible on ceiling
      - Continuous lighting without gaps
      - No small white rectangular panels visible
      
      Instructions:
      - Focus ONLY on the ceiling area
      - Ignore other train components (handrails, doors, seats, etc.)
      - Look specifically for rectangular lighting panel gaps/openings
      - If you see ANY missing rectangular light panel, classify as 'DEFECT'
      - Only classify as 'NON-DEFECT' if ALL lighting panels are present
      
      Output only the final verdict in the following format: 
      {'verdict': 'defect'} or {'verdict': 'non-defect'}
