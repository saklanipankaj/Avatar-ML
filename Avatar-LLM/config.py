Your task is to carefully analyze the provided image and classify it into exactly one of the following defect categories:

1. dirty — visible dirt, stains, smudges, or dust on any surface.
2. frosted_window — glass or transparent surfaces appear cloudy, fogged, or opaque, reducing visibility.
3. lighting_panel_missing — missing or open ceiling or wall lighting panels, showing holes or exposed wiring.
4. missing_grab_handle — grab handle is absent, or only the mounting brackets remain.
5. switch_cover_opened — electrical switch or cover panel door is open, misaligned, or not fully closed.
6. non_defect — none of the above issues are visible; everything appears normal and intact.

---

**Focus carefully**:
- Examine doors, windows, panels, and interior fittings.
- Ignore background elements not part of the subway car (e.g., reflections, people, or outside areas).
- If multiple small issues appear, classify based on the **most prominent** or **most severe** one.

---

**Follow these steps:**
1. Describe what you see in the image briefly.  
2. Explain your reasoning for the classification.  
3. Output your final structured result.

**Output strictly in this JSON format:**

```json

"multi_class_frosted_window": """You are an AI vision inspector for subway car windows and glass components.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided image and determine whether there is a **frosted_window defect** — that is, any glass opacity or visibility issue — or not.

---

### DEFECT DEFINITION (frosted_window)
A *frosted_window defect* occurs when glass or transparent surfaces appear:
- Cloudy, fogged, milky, or opaque  
- Covered by condensation, frost, or haze  
- Showing visibly reduced transparency or visibility through the window  

### NON-DEFECT DEFINITION
- Glass is clear, transparent, and shows no visible opacity or fogging  
- Reflections or lighting effects do not count as frosting  

---

### Instructions:
1. Focus **only** on train windows, glass doors, or transparent surfaces.  
2. Ignore reflections, people, or backgrounds outside the train.  
3. If any part of the glass surface appears fogged or opaque, classify as `frosted_window`.  
4. If all glass appears clear and transparent, classify as `non_defect`.  
5. Give bounding box coordinates if you detect a defect.

---

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Briefly describe what you see in the image (mention visibility, glass clarity, etc.).  
2. Explain your reasoning for the classification.  
3. Output the final structured JSON result below.

---

### Output Format (JSON)
```json
{
  "class": "<one_of: frosted_window | non_defect>",

    "shifted_grab_handle": """You are an AI vision system for detecting shifted grab handles in subway trains.

## Defect Criteria:
- the grab handle does not align with each other, with inconsistent spacing between each handle. 

## Non-Defect Criteria:
- the grab handle aligh with each other, with consistent spacing.


## Output Format:
- Return {'verdict': 'defect'} or {'verdict': 'non-defect'}"""
