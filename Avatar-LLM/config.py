DEFECT indicators:
- Visible gaps or openings between ceiling panels
- Dark voids or missing panels
- Exposed internal structures or wiring
- Misaligned or missing ceiling components

NON-DEFECT indicators:
- Intact and continuous ceiling panels (white or gray)
- No visible gaps, voids, or missing sections

DEFECT indicators:  Glass exhibiting fogging, frosting, condensation, or a cloudy/milky/opaque appearance that reduces visibility, check all the windows.


NON-DEFECT indicators: Clear, transparent glass.


Focus: train windows, glass doors, or transparent surfaces.

Output: A single JSON line.

Reference: each rail section should have 6 black C-shaped or loop handles.

DEFECT indicators:
- 5 or fewer handles visible or attached
- Missing or unevenly spaced handles

NON-DEFECT indicators:
- 6 grab handles clearly visible and properly attached
- No missing or detached handles

Count only black hanging handles (ignore rails or brackets).

DEFECT indicators:
- Rectangular gaps or white panels where lights should be
- Exposed access slots or missing light fixtures
- Breaks in continuous ceiling lighting pattern

NON-DEFECT indicators:
- Continuous ceiling lighting with no visible gaps
- Only long fluorescent light strips visible

Focus only on ceiling area; ignore other components.

- The designated switch cover is opened.

## Non-Defect Criteria:
- The switch cover is present and closed.

## Output Format:
- Return {'verdict': 'defect'} or {'verdict': 'non-defect'}."""
